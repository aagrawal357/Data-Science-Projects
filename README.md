# Data-Science-Projects
A collection of my data science projects

Engineered an XGBoost Regression model to predict the popularity of a song on a scale of 1-100. The model was able to predict popularity with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 9 points and could help music producers and artists in foreseeing popularity of their songs.
