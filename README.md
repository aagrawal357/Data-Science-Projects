# Predicting popularity of a song and designing a music recommender system

1) Engineered an XGBoost Regression model to predict the popularity of a song on a scale of 1-100. The model was able to predict popularity with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 9 points and could help music producers and artists in foreseeing popularity of their songs.

2) Designed a Spotifyâ€™s song radio like feature to recommend top 5 similar songs, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
